C code implementing a simple thesaurus

A simple project that works like a digitalized thesaurus, containing around 200 words.Each word has multiple synonyms, antnonyms,a figure of speech stored in the text file 'word.txt'.
There are around 8 functions used. 
The thesaurus allows the user to 
 1. Search for a word
 2. Search for all the words given starting letter
 3. Word of the day 
 4. Search history
 5. Add Word
 6. Pattern wise Search
 
 Word of the day randomly genereates a number and displays the word and its attributes present in that line of the text file 'word.txt'
 Pattern wise search allows the user to search by prefixes and postfixes
 
Search history, stores all the words the user has previously searched for in a text file 'history.txt'. The addfile functions allows the dynamic expansion of the thesaurus
